Python Examples for MSI
=======================

The IPython notebooks in this repository accompany the Python for Scientific Computing workshop hosted by the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. Visit https://www.msi.umn.edu/tutorials/python-scientific-computing for details and a PDF copy of the slides.

Getting started
---------------

You can clone a copy of this repository using git, for example:

    git clone https://github.com/mbmilligan/msi-ipython-nb-ex
    
If you have a web browser and are connected to the UMN network, you can access our JupyterHub server at: [notebooks.msi.umn.edu](https://notebooks.msi.umn.edu)

If you are at a command line at the MSI, the commands

    module load python
    cd msi-ipython-nb-ex
    ipython notebook

will start the Jupyter notebook system in your web browser. From there, you can open the saved IPython notebooks (files with the extension .ipynb) by clicking on them.
